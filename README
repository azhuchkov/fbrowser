===========================
 fBrowser Demo Application
===========================

Requirements
------------

JDK 1.7


Building
--------
The most simple way to build the application is to use Gradle wrapper that bootstraps itself and then do the job:

$ ./gradlew build


Running
-------

After the app is built (and its uber-jar is packaged), it's possible to run it:

$ java -jar build/libs/fbrowser-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

And that's it! No need to install external Servlet Container or something else.

To run it as a part of build lifecycle ( can be useful in development to be able to update static and template files ):

$ ./gradlew bootRun

NOTE: Hit <ctrl+c> to shutdown.
